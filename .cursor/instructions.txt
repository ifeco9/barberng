1. User Type Enforcement Protocol

Implement strict registration path separation:

Customer registration: Explicitly set isServiceProvider=false in Firestore

Barber registration: Require admin approval process before setting isServiceProvider=true

Add server-side validation through Firebase Functions to prevent manual field modification

2. Authentication Flow Correction

Establish pre-login validation checkpoints:

Verify Firestore document exists for authenticated UID

Confirm isServiceProvider field exists and is boolean type

Implement 3-second loading buffer to prevent premature navigation

Add automatic redirect if user accesses wrong portal (barber→customer UI)

3. Firestore Data Integrity Measures

Create schema validation rules:

javascript
Copy
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow write: if request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['isServiceProvider']) 
              && typeof(request.resource.data.isServiceProvider) == 'boolean';
}
Implement historical versioning for user type changes

Set up Cloud Function triggers to audit permission changes

4. UI Rendering Safeguards

Develop multi-layer rendering checks:

Device-level authentication state verification

Fresh Firestore data fetch on app resume

Visual confirmation system (watermark overlays showing user type)

Feature lockdown for mismatched permissions

5. Debugging Infrastructure

Implement forensic logging:

Track user type decision path through analytics events

Record screen transition attempts with timestamp/UID

Create error taxonomy:

E1: Missing user type flag

E2: UI-component mismatch

E3: Cross-role access attempt

6. Recovery Protocol

Build automatic fallback states:

If user type undefined → redirect to role selection

If data mismatch detected → trigger admin alert

Persistent errors → temporary access revocation

Develop manual override system with admin PIN protection

7. Testing Matrix Requirements

Create 12 test scenarios:

User Type	Login Method	Network State	Expected Outcome
Valid Customer	Email	Online	Customer UI
Valid Barber	Email	Offline	Barber UI (cached)
... (expand with edge cases)
8. User Session Hardening

Implement session fingerprinting:

Device ID binding

Location pattern analysis

Usage behavior profiling

Establish automatic session termination for:

Cross-role component access attempts

Rapid screen switching anomalies

Backend data conflicts

9. UI Component Isolation

Develop feature quarantine system:

Barber-specific components self-disable in customer context

Customer features auto-hide with CSS masking in barber UI

Implement runtime component validation checks

10. Continuous Monitoring Setup

Configure real-time alerts for:

User type field modifications

Cross-portal navigation patterns

Authentication state conflicts

Build dashboard tracking:

Role-based active sessions

UI rendering failures

Permission validation latency

Implementation Strategy:

Start with data integrity audits (points 3,10)

Build authentication safeguards (points 2,8)

Implement UI quarantine system (points 4,9)

Deploy monitoring infrastructure (points 5,10)

Critical First Steps:

Export all user documents and verify isServiceProvider field:

Existence check

Boolean validation

Historical consistency audit

Implement temporary client-side lockdown:

Show maintenance screen during role validation

Disable all role-specific features until validation completes

Let's break this down into a structured action plan to resolve the user type differentiation and screen rendering issues:

1. Data Integrity Foundation

Firestore Document Audit:
Export all user documents → Verify every entry has:

isServiceProvider field exists

Field value is strictly boolean (true/false)

No null/undefined/string values present

Field Enforcement Protocol:
Implement server-side rules:

javascript
Copy
match /users/{userId} {
  allow write: if request.resource.data.isServiceProvider is boolean
             && request.resource.data.isServiceProvider != null;
}
2. Authentication Flow Hardening

Pre-Navigation Checklist:
Before any screen redirects, require:

Fresh Firestore data fetch (no cache)

Three consecutive validations of user type

Network connectivity confirmation

Session Fingerprinting:
Bind sessions to:

Device hardware ID

Last-known valid user type

Geographic login pattern

3. UI Rendering Safeguards

Layer 1: Component Quarantine
Wrap all role-specific features with:

dart
Copy
Visibility(
  visible: context.watch<UserProvider>().isValidBarber,
  child: [Barber Feature],
)
Layer 2: Visual Confirmation
Implement persistent UI indicators:

Customer UI: Blue header banner with "CUSTOMER MODE"

Barber UI: Red footer bar with "BARBER DASHBOARD"

4. Error Recovery System

Automated Response Matrix:

Error Type	Response
Missing user type	Force re-authentication → Role selection screen
Data conflict	Freeze UI → Show admin contact overlay
Session mismatch	Logout → Send security alert email
5. Testing Protocol

Scenario Simulation:

Valid customer → locked customer UI test

Valid barber → restricted barber tools test

Modified user type → session invalidation test

6. Monitoring Infrastructure

Create real-time dashboard tracking:

User type validation success rate

Screen rendering failures per session

Cross-role access attempt frequency

Implementation Sequence:

Phase 1 (48hrs): Data cleanup + Firestore rules

Phase 2 (72hrs): Authentication hardening + UI safeguards

Phase 3 (Ongoing): Monitoring + automated recovery

First Immediate Steps:

Run this emergency data validation query:

bash
Copy
firebase firestore:query users --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID 
--where="isServiceProvider" --filter="isServiceProvider != true && isServiceProvider != false"
Add temporary UI lockdown:

dart
Copy
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  if (userType == null) return MaintenanceScreen();
  // Original logic
}
